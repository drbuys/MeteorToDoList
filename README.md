# Meteor To-Do List

## Setup Instructions
This project uses Meteor. You will need to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) first.

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/drbuys/MeteorToDoList.git
$ cd MeteorToDoList
$ git checkout broken
$ git checkout -b 'ParticipantsName'

$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

## Purpose
- This project is intended to highlight the approach to problem solving of the participant.
- The code is broken, and the errors should give an indication as to where and how to fix the code in order to get the app running again as expected.
- The participant should checkout their own branch from the branch '*broken*' as specified above. The branch '*working*' has the working code in it for comparison
