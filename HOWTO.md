# Meteor To-Do List

## What it should do
A simple app to manage a 'to do' list and collaborate with others on those tasks.

When a user has registered they can:

- add a task that will be associated with their username
- mark any tasks as completed
- toggle the display to hide completed tasks
- toggle tasks as public or private (As public they can be viewed by anyone. As private they can only be viewed by the user when they are logged in)
- delete any task

Also the number of uncompleted tasks is displayed at the top left.

## What you should look at

You may need to look at the files '*App.jsx*' and '*Task.jsx*' in '*./imports/ui/*', along with any of the files in the '*./client*' folder.
